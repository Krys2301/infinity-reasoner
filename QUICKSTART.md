# 🚀 INFINITY REASONER - Quick Start Guide

Welcome to **Infinity Reasoner**, the self-evolving AI system that learns through autonomous task generation and solving!

## 🎯 What is Infinity?

Infinity is based on the revolutionary "Absolute Zero" paradigm - an AI system that:
- 🧠 **Generates its own learning tasks** (no human data required)
- 🔄 **Evolves through self-play** (proposer + solver roles)
- 🛡️ **Includes safety monitoring** (human oversight required)
- 📊 **Tracks its own progress** (real-time performance metrics)

## ⚡ Quick Installation

### Option 1: One-Command Setup (Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Krys2301/infinity-reasoner.git
cd infinity-reasoner
chmod +x setup.sh start_infinity.sh
./setup.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Krys2301/infinity-reasoner.git
cd infinity-reasoner
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Running Infinity

### Simple Start
```bash
./start_infinity.sh
```

### Direct Python Execution
```bash
python3 infinity_reasoner.py
```

### Custom Configuration
```bash
python3 infinity_reasoner.py --iterations 10 --tasks-per-iteration 5
```

## 🎮 What to Expect

When you run Infinity, you'll see:

1. **🌟 System Initialization**
   - Model loading (DialoGPT-medium by default)
   - Safety monitoring activation
   - Device detection (CUDA/CPU)

2. **🔄 Evolution Iterations**
   - **PROPOSE**: AI generates coding tasks
   - **SOLVE**: AI attempts to solve them
   - **VALIDATE**: Code execution with safety checks
   - **LEARN**: Performance tracking and improvement

3. **👤 Human Oversight**
   - Review flagged tasks when prompted
   - Approve/reject suspicious content
   - Monitor system behavior
